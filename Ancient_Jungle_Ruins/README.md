🌿🏛️ Cinematic Ancient Jungle Ruins in Unreal Engine 5 🌅💧
 I’ve been working on an overgrown temple environment deep within a lush jungle, focusing on cinematic atmosphere, lighting, and environmental storytelling.
 🔹 The scene features dense tropical vegetation, ancient stone ruins reclaimed by nature, and reflective water surfaces that enhance the mood of mystery and discovery.
 🔹 Built using Nanite and Lumen for ultra-realistic detail, global illumination, and soft light diffusion through foliage.
 🔹 Most assets are a blend of custom models, Quixel Megascans, and procedural foliage systems to create a natural, seamless ecosystem.
 🔹 This project highlights Unreal Engine 5’s real-time rendering power and my passion for crafting cinematic worlds that feel alive and timeless.
 🎥 Rendered in 4K high settings, this environment explores how light, decay, and nature intertwine to tell the silent story of forgotten civilizations.
